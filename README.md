This is a project to build a dynamic and interactive website using HTML, CSS and Javascript!

I am applying the CSS responsive design principles that I have learnt thus far - Flexbox and Flex Grid, precisely.

I am also applying JavaScript Event listeners that interact with the DOM.

I am super proud of myself! ðŸ˜Š
